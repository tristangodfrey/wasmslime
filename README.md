# Slime Mold Simulator

## TODO

[ ] - Switch `Point` for a library that has vectors/coords
[ ] - Improve rng performance (function is blocking, either spawn threads or do async? or pre-generate a batch of numbers?)
[x] - Fix the bug of cells randomly dying

## Notes

Does the vector of cells really need to be ordered by coordinates?
